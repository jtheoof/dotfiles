SublimeLinter 1.5.7 changelog

CHANGES/FIXES

- node.js is the preferred Javascript engine on Mac OS X and will be used if it is installed.
  JavaScriptCore does not handle non-ASCII text correctly and you should install node.js
  if possible.

- If you imported BaseLinter.JSC_PATH, please change your linter to use the self.jsc_path()
  method instead. JSC_PATH should no longer be considered public.

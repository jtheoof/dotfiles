SublimeLinter 1.6.2 changelog

CHANGES/FIXES

- Replaced the default perl linter with Perl::Critic. The standard Perl syntax checker
  can still be invoked by switching the "perl_linter" setting to "perl".

- Added a LICENSE file to define appropriate usage of SublimeLinter and its source.

- Converted README back to markdown.


IMPORTANT

Due to a vulnerability (issue #77) with the Perl linter, Perl syntax checking is no longer
enabled by default. The default linter for Perl has been replaced by Perl::Critic.

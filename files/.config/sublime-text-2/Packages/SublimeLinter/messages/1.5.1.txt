SublimeLinter 1.5.1 changelog

Please restart Sublime Text 2 after reading this.

NEW FEATURES

- SublimeLinter keeps its settings in its own settings file now:
  SublimeLinter.sublime-settings. You will need to copy your
  user settings to this file. To do so, follow these steps:

  1. Select "Preferences->Settings - User" in one tab/window.
     The title of this tab should be "Preferences.sublime-settings".
  2. Open another tab/window and select "Preferences->Package Settings->
     SublimeLinter->Settings - User". The title of this window should be
     "SublimeLinter.sublime-settings".
  3. Copy/cut any of the following settings from Preferences.sublime-settings
     to SublimeLinter.sublime-settings:

     sublimelinter
     sublimelinter_executable_map
     sublimelinter_syntax_map
     sublimelinter_disable
     sublimelinter_delay
     sublimelinter_fill_outlines
     sublimelinter_gutter_marks
     sublimelinter_wrap_find
     sublimelinter_popup_errors_on_save
     javascript_linter
     jshint_options
     pep8_ignore
     pyflakes_ignore
     pyflakes_ignore_import_*
     sublimelinter_objj_check_ascii

  4. Save SublimeLinter.sublime-settings. The changes may not take
     effect until you restart Sublime Text.

  When changes are made to the user SublimeLinter settings, they
  are immediately reloaded into every open view. Note that this will
  override any temporary changes you may have made to the settings in
  a given view.

- The google closure Javascript linter (gjslint) is now supported
  (https://developers.google.com/closure/utilities/docs/linter_howto).
  There is a new setting, "javascript_linter", which determines which
  linter to use, jshint or gjslinter. You may also customize gjslint
  behavior with the "gjslint_options" and "gjslint_ignore" settings.
  Please select "Preferences->Package Settings->SublimeLinter->Settings - Default"
  for more information on these settings.

- The color theme names have been changed to avoid clashes with
  built in names.

    Old                     New
    ---------------------   -----------------------------
    sublimelinter.<type>    sublimelinter.outline.<type>
    invalid.<type>          sublimelinter.underline.<type>

  You will have to update your color themes accordingly. Please select
  "Preferences->Package Settings->SublimeLinter->README" and search
  for "Customizing colors" for more information.

- When selecting an error from the popup error list, the view is centered
  on the error line.


CHANGES/FIXES

- The PHP error regex has been updated to work with PHP 5.3.8 on Mac OS X.

- The popup error list will no longer choke on non-ASCII text.

- Selecting an error from the popup error list no longer attempts to go
  directly to the point of an error as this could not be done reliably.
  It will jump to the first non-whitespace character of the error's line.

- Go to next/previous error works correctly when an error line has no underlines.

- If an exception is thrown by jshint (e.g. too many errors), the errors
  captured up to that point are displayed.

- The built in jshint has been updated from the master jshint.

- Fixed errors that would occur with the popup error list when there was
  more than error on a line.

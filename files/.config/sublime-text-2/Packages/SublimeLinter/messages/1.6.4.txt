SublimeLinter 1.6.4 changelog

IMPORTANT!!

Please note that the SublimeLinter repository has moved to:

  https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter

Issues and pull requests should be made there.


NEW FEATURES

- The Objective-J linter now catches spaces inside parentheses
  and dependent clauses on the same line as a control structure.


CHANGES/FIXES

- The README has been reorganized to hopefully be clearer.

- More explicit Node.js installation instructions have been provided.

- The "pep8" setting is now recognized in SublimeLinter's settings.

- When a minimum delay is specified with the "sublimelinter_delay" setting,
  SublimeLinter will only lint the currently displayed file when the
  queued linters run. This allows you to avoid linting of files as they
  are selected in the choose file palette.

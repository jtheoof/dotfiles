This package is simply to help people who want to try out a lot of color schemes.  It is the top 100 rated color schemes on vim.sf.net as of Jan 20th, 2010 that are are not "evil" (binding keys, changing fonts, etc) --  zipped up in a single package.  Every single theme was updated to its newest revision, and converted to unix formatted line endings. 

Check out a demo of these themes at: http://www.vi-improved.org/color_sampler_pack/

The menu has been simplified based on feedback to simply three categories.  Dark / Light / Other. 

This package was put together simply to save others time in downloading the color schemes.  If you are a scheme author and for some reason do not want your scheme included, please simply drop me a note.  iam -at- robertmelton.com

Now, the pack comes with an organized GUI menu, but no tool for console users.  I recommend you pick up http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1488 which is a colorscheme scroller / chooser and browser.  

Many of these schemes are Gvim only, and do not support consoles well... but there is a plugin to allow Gvim only themes to work in 88/256 color terminals -> http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2390.

Love it or Hate it -- Rate it.  :)

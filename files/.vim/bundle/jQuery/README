jQuery is a fast and concise JavaScript Library that simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling, animating, and Ajax interactions for rapid web development. jQuery is designed to change the way that you write JavaScript. See http://jquery.com/ for more details.

The syntax file for Vim add some colorations for jQuery keywords (empty clone hasClass hide show animate ...) and for CSS selectors (:empty :hidden :selected :first ...).

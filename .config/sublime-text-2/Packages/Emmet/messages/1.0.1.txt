New features:

Fuzzy search for CSS abbreviations
==================================

Emmet now supports fuzzy searching of unknowns CSS abbreviations.
For example, instead of using ov:h abbreviation to get overflow: hidden, you can write, ov-h, ovh or even oh.

Emmet CSS snippets in auto-complete popup
=========================================

All Emmet snippets are displayed in standard auto-complete popup,
so you don't need to remember them all: just start typing first 
letters of required CSS snippet and let editor do the rest 
(works with fuzzy search too).

To disable Emmet completions, set

"show_css_completions": false

preference in user's Emmet.sublime-settings

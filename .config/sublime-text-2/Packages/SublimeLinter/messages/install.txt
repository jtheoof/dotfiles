SublimeLinter
=============

SublimeLinter is a plugin that supports "lint" programs (known as "linters"). SublimeLinter highlights
lines of code the linter deems to contain (potential) errors. It also
supports highlighting special annotations (for example: TODO) so that they
can be quickly located.

SublimeLinter has built in linters for the following languages:

* C/C++ - lint via `cppcheck`
* CoffeeScript - lint via `coffee -s -l`
* CSS - lint via built-in [csslint](http://csslint.net)
* Git Commit Messages - lint via built-in module based on [A Note About Git Commit Messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
* Haml - syntax check via `haml -c`
* HTML - lint via `tidy` (actually [tidy for HTML5](http://w3c.github.com/tidy-html5/))
* Java - lint via `javac -Xlint`
* Javascript - lint via built in [jshint](http://jshint.org), [jslint](http://jslint.com), or the [closure linter (gjslint)](https://developers.google.com/closure/utilities/docs/linter_howto) (if installed)
* Lua - syntax check via `luac`
* Objective-J - lint via built-in [capp_lint](https://github.com/aparajita/capp_lint)
* Perl - lint via [Perl:Critic](http://perlcritic.com/) or syntax+deprecation check via `perl -c`
* PHP - syntax check via `php -l`
* Puppet - syntax check via `puppet parser validate`
* Python - native, moderately-complete lint
* Ruby - syntax check via `ruby -wc`
* XML - lint via `xmllint`

IMPORTANT

Do NOT edit the default SublimeLinter settings. Your changes will be lost
when SublimeLinter is updated. ALWAYS edit the user SublimeLinter settings
by selecting "Preferences->Package Settings->SublimeLinter->Settings - User".
Note that individual settings you include in your user settings will **completely**
replace the corresponding default setting, so you must provide that setting in its entirety.

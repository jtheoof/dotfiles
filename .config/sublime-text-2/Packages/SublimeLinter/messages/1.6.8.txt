SublimeLinter 1.6.8 changelog

NEW FEATURES

- HTML5 linting support via `tidy`. This linter will not run unless you have
  a version of tidy with HTML5 support. To use this linter, please see:
  https://github.com/w3c/tidy-html5

- XML linting via `xmllint`.


CHANGES/FIXES

- Made significant progress on issue (#181). However, SublimeLinter still
  throws with some linter types on Windows 7 when a user has non-ascii
  characters in the path (to the SL plugin).

- Updated PEP8 to v1.1

- Updated Pyflakes to v0.5.0

- Updated JSHint to latest stable (r11).

- Reverted a fix for accurate (JSHint) error column positions (when using tab
  indentation) due to a regression with the `"white": true` option. You may
  still manually fix error positions by setting `"indent": 1`.

- Changed (the default) background linting delay to a more sane 2 seconds.
  This reduces memory usage, cpu processing, and visual noise while you are
  actively writing code.
